# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose
The purpose of this election audit is to read the election results csv file and make conclusions based on the data in the csv file. Using python functions such as if statements and for loops to read the csv file, I was able to find the voter turnout per county and what percent each county turnout was compared to the total vote. Using this information, I was able to determine the county with the largest voter turnout. I also was able to find the winning candidate and how many votes each candidate received. I printed these results to the terminal line and in a txt file. Python makes the process of counting the results fast, efficient, and accurate.

## Results

* Denver county had the largest number of votes.
* Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes, Diana Degette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

### Business Proposal
This script can be used for any election. It allows you to quickly understand the available data. For instance, the counties where the turnout is low, more money could be invested into advertising and education around elections to garner more participation. We also can quickly find out who won the election and what percentage of the vote they received. This is more efficient than counting the votes one by one which could lead to human error. We could modify the script to find out more information. One way to modify the script would be to add an if statement to the code to determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate. This would help us to understand which candidate was most popular in each county. We could also modify the script so that it would be effective on a federal level. For instance, instead of county, we could modify it to be states. This would allow us to use the script on a larger scale.
